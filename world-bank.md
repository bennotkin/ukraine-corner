### World Bank Group Response & News

- World Bank Group, 17 March 2022, ["Joint Statement of Heads of International Financial Institutions with programs in Ukraine and neighboring countries"](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/statement/2022/03/17/joint-statement-of-heads-of-international-financial-institutions-with-programs-in-ukraine-and-neighboring-countries)

  > The World Bank also set up a multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) that is among the most rapid, targeted, and secure mechanisms to facilitate channeling grant resources from donors to Ukraine, with contributions of US$145 million thus far. The World Bank Group is also working on options to assist neighboring countries, including to support refugee populations, and will continue to provide trade finance to support the private sector.

- World Bank Group, 14 March 2022, ["World Bank Announces Additional $200 Million in Financing for Ukraine"](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/03/14/world-bank-announces-additional-200-million-in-financing-for-ukraine)

  > This comes on top of the $723 million mobilized for Ukraine and its people last week, of which $350 million has already been disbursed to Ukraine. This financing is part of the $3 billion package of support that the World Bank Group previously announced it is preparing for Ukraine over the coming months.

- IMF, 1 March 2022, ["Joint IMF-World Bank Group Statement on the War in Ukraine"](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2022/03/01/pr2252-joint-imf-world-bank-group-statement-on-the-war-in-ukraine)

  > We stand with the Ukrainian people through these horrifying developments. The war is also creating significant spillovers to other countries. Commodity prices are being driven higher and risk further fueling inflation, which hits the poor the hardest. Disruptions in financial markets will continue to worsen should the conflict persist. The sanctions announced over the last few days will also have a significant economic impact. We are assessing the situation and discussing appropriate policy responses with our international partners.

  > At the World Bank Group, we are preparing a $3 billion package of support in the coming months, starting with a fast-disbursing budget support operation for at least $350 million that will be submitted to the Board for approval this week, followed by $200 million in fast-disbursing support for health and education. This package will include the mobilization of financing from several development partners, and we welcome the already-announced support from many bilateral partners.
