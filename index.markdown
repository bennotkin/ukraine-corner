This site exists to collect interim analyses and datasets that communicate the spillover effects of the on-going Ukraine crisis. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been incredibly deadly and destructive, and will likely have long-lasting consequences in Ukraine as well as in Russia. The crisis, though, extends beyond the borders of these warring nations to the many states whose economies and societies are interwoven with Ukraine and Russia. The disruptive violence of the invasion and the consequent sanctions on Russia produce compounding risks in many nations that rely on the countries for food goods (particularly cereals and vegetable oils), energy, COVID-19 vaccines, and remittances – as well as in those countries that are less directly reliant, but which will suffer price shocks in those sectors.

Below are a selection of reports and media that attempt to understanding the far-reaching and interconnected effects of the Ukraine crisis. See the [Data](/Data) tab for relevant datasets. If you have additional materials to include, please share them [here].

## Global Overview

### In-depth Analyses

- UNCTAD, 16 March 2022, ["The Impact on Trade and Development of the War in Ukraine"](https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/osginf2022d1_en.pdf)
  
  `Trade` `Energy` `Food`

  An assessment of the invasion's impact on food items and countries exposed to supply shocks, on transport, on finance and investment, and on energy transition, with a focus throughout on consumer price increases.

  > The results confirm a rapidly worsening outlook for the world economy, underpinned by rising food, fuel and fertilizer prices, heightened financial volatility, sustainable development divestment, complex global supply chain reconfigurations and mounting trade costs. ¶ This rapidly evolving situation is alarming for developing countries, and especially for African and least developed countries, some of which are particularly exposed to the war in Ukraine and its effect on trade costs, commodity prices and financial markets. The risk of civil unrest, food shortages and inflation-induced recessions cannot be discounted, particularly given the fragile state of the global economy and the developing world as a result of the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) pandemic.

- FAO, 10 March 2022, ["The importance of Ukraine and the Russian Federation for global agricultural markets and the risks associated with the current conflict"](https://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/faoweb/2022/Info-Note-Ukraine-Russian-Federation.pdf)

  `Trade` `Energy` `Food` `Macroeconomic`
  
  An in-depth report on trade, production, price, logistical, humanitarian, and energy risks. It includes charts on Russian and Ukrainian export commodities and other countries dependency on those exports, and food price charts.
  
  > During the first week of March 2022, U.S. wheat futures climbed past their record highs reached in 2008. The strength prevailing in wheat markets, that is also influencing maize quotations, which increased by 44 percent above their year-earlier levels in 2021, received a further boost from production uncertainties in South America, higher input and transport costs, as well as port disruptions. In the rapeseed oil and sunflowerseed oil sectors, annual price increases registered in 2021 were in the order of 65 and 63 percent, respectively, being spurred by protracted global supply tightness and robust demand, and in the case of rapeseed oil also from the biodiesel sector. Currently, sunflower oil is being traded at near-record highs. While sunflowerseed oil is highly substitutable with other vegetable oils, wheat is not. Wheat is a staple food for over 35 percent of the world's population, and the lack of substitutability and dietary diversity will likely compound the pressure on wheat prices.
